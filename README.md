# Small things for ArcBotics Sparki
I wrote it for my son Ilya. But you can use it too.  

## Stars
It draw stars.  
On start Sparki is in remote control mode. You can push any buttons except `+`. Button `-` is not working in this mode.  
When you push `+` button Sparki starts waiting for number of rays for stars.  
0 - 3 rays  
1 - 4 rays  
2 - 5 rays
etc.  
  
After you push number it will draw beautiful star for you!  
To exit draw stars mode push `-` button.

## Battleship
On start Sparki wil make random movements. But when you click `stop` button Sparki is ready to play Battleship (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))!  
It uses Star Wars version of this game, so:  
```
Type of ship                           Size    Number per player
battleship /four-decker /four-funnel     4       1
cruiser /three-decker /three-funnel      3       2
destroyer /two-decker /two-funnel        2       3
submarine /single-decker /single-funnel  1       4
```

To enter your move push 0-9 for A-J and then 0-9 for 1-10.
Don't forget to draw your battleships first. Sparki will do it too.
